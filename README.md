# Clustering

Clustering with good coffee

I change the build of ClusterOfSequence by adding a name :
It takes the first letter of all sequence contained and here your title
this process add 0.5ms to the clusterize process of hemoglobina (53.49s to 54.00s)
A way to build it differently :
 - create a custom name in the `create_foam_rep()` method
  
This way this feature `name` would only slow the method using it
